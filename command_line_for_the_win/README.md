## Program Descriptions

1. **0-first_9_tasks**
   - A script containing commands and solutions for the first 9 tasks, each focusing on a specific command-line task or challenge.

2. **1-next-9-tasks**
   - A continuation of the previous script, containing solutions for the next 9 tasks in the challenge.

3. **2-last-9-tasks**
   - The final script in this series, providing solutions for the last 9 tasks in the challenge.

## How to Use

Each script contains a series of commands and solutions for specific tasks. You can run these commands in your command-line interface to complete the corresponding tasks.

For example, to solve the tasks in "0-first_9_tasks," you can execute the commands provided in the script.
