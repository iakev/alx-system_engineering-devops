THE INFRASTRUCTURE

Once the DNS resolver gives the browser the correct IP address for www.foobar.com, then we add a load balancer that acts as the IP address 8.8.8.8
The load balancer acts to reduce the load on any one single server by adding another server to the configuration.
The server we add is a complete replica in terms of hardware specifications such that, we use the Round Robin scheduling whereby requests are sent to one server and then the next.
The load balancer enables an Active-Active setup where both servers are actively serving up content to the web browser via the web server. In contrast, an Active-Passive setup is where one server is always online with the second one on standby. When the online server is at fault the standby server comes online and works while the faulty server is serviced/maintained.
In both servers, all the components are replicas of each other except the database. Since we are using an Active-Active setup there is a primary database and a replica database. The Primary database is the main database and the only database allowing write operations on the database. Hence when an HTTP request is sent from the user that contains methods for writing to the database e.g POST requests, the load balancer allocates those requests to the server with the primary database. The replica database as the name suggests is a replica of the primary database but cannot write to the database. This is to ensure one source of truth in the database. Once these changes are recorded in the master database they are made to trickle down to the replica database during synchronization to ultimately ensure the replica database and primary database are identical. When an HTTP request performs read operations on the database e.g GET requests, the load balancer employs the Round Robin scheduling to both servers since they are both open to performing read operations on their respective databases. When static file requests are made to the load balancer they are also subject to the Round Robin schedule.

SPOF: The single point of failure in this scenario is the load balancer. In case of a malfunction of the load balancer, the user will not get the request to the server at all.
No firewall: When no division is done between a private network and outer network which in internet security is considered the bare minimum, unwanted and unsolicited incoming network traffic can keep our network traffic busy and make us vulnerable to security threats such as Malware attacks. Firewalls aid us in complying with standards. In cases where site 8.8.8.8 is an organization, we are unable to limit employers from using certain sites that we think will not be in the company's best interest and will not aid in the productivity goal of the company. Firewalls also aid in the prevention of loss of data. So no firewall can make us vulnerable in that area.
No monitoring: Applications and servers should be tested. Eg of the tests is if the website responds well from different locations. That way users from around the globe can access our website with no errors. And any owner of a website should check the load time of the website he/she is providing to users as slow load time can immensely affect the users revisiting probabilities because other providers may do a better job.
