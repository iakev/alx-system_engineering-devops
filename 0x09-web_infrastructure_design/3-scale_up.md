Scale up
We added one more server to our current setup. The server is connected to a load balancer as its own cluster. This load balancer is then on the same level as the previous load balancer. These two balancers are then connected to a different load balancer that unites them so as to use the same IP address 8.8.8.8 that maps to the domain www.foobar.com
The newest load balancer is then connected to a server. This server consists of different components separated. That is a database server on its own, an application server on its own, a web server on its own, and the code base is the only one hosted in the main server. The SSL layer is added to this configuration as well as monitoring services described below. This configuration boasts of an active-passive connection whereby the new server and load balancer are on standby. Hence, the newly added cluster only picks up when the old cluster services are down. 

This infrastructure, though expensive, has some advantages in that it's easy to scale up operations on both clusters by adding nodes. The system is more redundant since if one cluster fails the second one picks up, thereby providing high availability. The network is still protected by a firewall, therefore, increasing reliability. Now in the new server that has been added, there is an advantage of separating the components into their own servers. This is because if there is maintenance required on the database then only this component is affected still providing services not dependent on the database. If the application server needs maintenance then it doesn't affect other components. This makes it easier to also do vertical scaling of one component while still avoiding the total failure of web services.
